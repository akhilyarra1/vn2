Scalabiltiy & High Availabilty

1.Scalabilty means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting
2.there are two kind of scalability:
   1.vertical Scalability
   2.Horizontal scalabilty
Scalability is linked but different to high ava

Vertical Scalability:

1.Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of an instance
2.for ex: your application is running on t2.micro
3.scaling that application vertically means running it on t2.large
4.Verticial scalability is very common for non distributed system such as database
5.RDS , ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically


Horizontal Scalability:

1.Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instance / system for your application
2.this us very common for web application/modern application

why use a load balancer .?

1.spread load across multiple downstream instances
2.expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
3.handle failures
4.seprate public traffic to private traffic

ec2 load balancer
1.an ELB load balancer is a managed load balancer
   aws gurantee that it will be working
   aws takes care of upgrades , maintainece , ha
