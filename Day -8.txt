Load balncer security groups

Key points:

1.LBs can scale but not instantaneoulsy - contact aws for a "warm-up"
2.troubleshooting
  1.4xx errors are client induced errors
  2.5xx errors are application induced error
  3.load balancer errors 503 means at capacity or no registered targets
  4.if the lb cant connect to your application check your security groups
3.Monitoring
 1.ELB access logs will log all access request
 2.cloudwatch metrics will give you statistics

1.Classic Load Balancer(v1)

1.Supports TCP,HTTP & HTTPS
2.health checks are tcp or http based
3.fixed hostname
xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com


Application Load Balancer (v2)

1.Application load balancer is layer 7 (HTTP)
2.load balancing to multiple HTTP application across machines (targte group)
3.Load balancing to mutplie application on the same machine(ex:container)
4.support for HTTP/S and Websocket


Routing tables of different target groups:
 1.Routing based on url=(example.com/users & example.com/posts)
 2.routing based on hostname in url ( one.example.com)

use case
ALB are great fit for micro-services & container based application
(ex docker & amazon ecs)

target groups:
1.ec2 instances
2.lamda functions
3.ip address
