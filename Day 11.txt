AWS Router53 

1.Route53 is a Managed DNS ( Domain name system)
2.DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through its domain name
In  AWS , the most common records are:
  A:hostname to IPv4
  AAAA:hostname to IPv6
  Cname:hostname to hostname
  ALias:hostname to AWS resources


route53 can use:
1.public domain names you own (or buy)
2.private domain names that can be resolved by your instance in your vpc

route53 has advanced:
1.load balancing ( through dns )
2.Health checks
3.Routing policy


you pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone

Instantiating application quickly

when launching a full stack (ec2,rds,ebs) it can take time to:
  1.install application
  2.recovery of data
  3.configure everything
  4.launch the application

EC2 instance:

 use a golden ami: install your application , os dependencies , before and launch your ec3 instance form the golden ami
 boostraping using user data: user data scripts
 hybrid: mixing both golden ami and user data

RDS databases:
  restore a snapshot the database will have schemas and data ready
ebs volumes:
  restore the snapshot



Developer problems in aws:

 1.managing infrastructure
 2.deploying code
  3.configuring all the databases , load balancers
 4.scaling operations
