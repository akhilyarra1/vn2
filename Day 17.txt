Subnets :

1.AWS reserves 5 Ips address ( first 4 and last 1 Ip address ) in each subnet
these 5 Ips are not avaiable for use and cannot be assigned to any instance
ex: if CIDR Block 10.0.0.0/24 
   reserved Ip are:
   10.0.0.0 : Network address
   10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for vpc router
   10.0.0.2 : Reserverd by aws provided DNS
   10.0.0.3:aws for future use
   10.0.0.255: Network brodcast address, AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC


If you need 29 Ip address for EC2 instance ,you cant choose a subnet of size /27 ( 32 Ip)
you need atleast 64 Ip,subnet size /26 ( 64 -5 =59 >29  but 32 -5= 27 <29)


CIDRs
102.168.0.0/24 = ?
(256 Ip )
/16:
(65536 Ip)
/32 
(only 1)
0.0.0.0/0
all ip



/32 allow for 1 Ip =2^0
/31 allows for 2 Ip = 2^1
/30            4     = 2^2



/24 allows for 256 ip = 2^8
/16 allows for 65536 Ip =2^16
/0 = 2^32

CIDR:
A CIDR has two components:
  1.the base Ip (xx.xx.xx.xx)
  2.The subnet mask (/26)

the base Ip represents an Ip contained in the range
the subnet mask defines how many bits can change in the IP

255.255.255.0 -->less common
/24 --- > More common


Internet Gateway:

1.Internet Gateway helps our VPC instance connect with the internet
2.it scales horizontally and is HA
3.Must be created separately from VPC
4.one vpc can only be attached to one IGW 

Internet Gateways on their own do not allow internet
Route tables must be editied..!!!
