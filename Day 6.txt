whats an EBS Volume .?

1.An EBS(Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instance
while they run
2.It allows your instance to persist data , even after their termination
3.They can only be mounted to one instance at a time ( at the CP level)
4.They are bound to a specific AV

Think EBS like a "network USB stick"
Free tier: 30 GB of Free EBS storage of type General purpose SSD or magnetic per month


EBS volume:

1.Its a network drive(not a physical drive)
2.Its locked to an AZ
   1.An EBS volume in us-east-1a cannot be atttached to us-east-1b
    2.to move a vloume across,first you need to snapshot it



us-east-1a                                   1b


1ec2              2ec2                      1ec2


ebs(100 gb)      2ebs(200gb)                 ebs(100gb)


EBS Snapshot:

1.Make a backup(snapshot) of your ebs volume at point in time
2.Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot , but recommended
3.Can copy snapshot across AZ or Region

us-east-1a                                       us-east-1b

ec2                                                  ec2


ebs ------------------- snapshot  --------------     ebs    




1.Create a volume (not encrypted)
2.we will take a snapshot ( not encrypted )
3.we will copy a snapshot from a snaphot (encrypted)
4.we will attach volume (encrypted)   




AMI Overview:

1.Amazon Machine Image
2.AMI are a customization of an ec2 instance
   1.you can add own software , configuration ,operating system , monitoring ..
   2.Faster boot/ all software which you need is pre-packaged
3.AMI are bulit for a specific region ( and can be copieacross region)




Process:

1.we will start an ec2 instance with some customize
2.stop the instance 
3.build the ami - ebs snapshot
4.launch instance 

us-east-1a                                       us-east-1b
 ec2   -------------custom ami------------------- ec2                                                 
        create ami                 launch from ami



Task:
1.create an ec2 instance with user data script 
  and check are you getting hello world using public ip
2.create an AMI with it
3.launch an ec2 instance with that AMI
4.check are you getting hello world output
