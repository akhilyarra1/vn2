Aurora Overview:

1.Compatible APi for Postgres/MYsql
2.Data is held in 6 replicas across 3 AZ
3.Multi AZ , Auto Scaling Read Replicas
4.Auto Scaling of Storage from 10GB to 64TB
Aurora serverless - for unpredictable workloads

use case: Same as RDS , but less maintaince / more flexbility / more performace

Aurora for Solution Archiect:

1.operation: less operation, auto scaling storage
2.Security: AWS reponsible for Os security , we are responsible for setting up KMS , security groups ,IAM policies
3.Reliability: MUlti AZ, highly available ,possibly more than RDS, Aurora serverless option 
4.Performance: 5x performance , up to 15 read replicas ( only 5 for RDS )
5.Cost: Pay per hour based on EC2 and storage usage, possibly lower cost compared to Entreprise database such as Oracle


DynamoDB

1.AWS technology , Managed NOSQL database
2.Serverless, provisioned capacity , auto scaling 
3.Highly avaiable, Multi AZ by default , Auto Scaling Read and write
4.Security , authentication and authorization is done through IAM
5.DynamoDb Streams to integrate with AWS Lambda
6.backup/restore feature
7.Monitoring through cloudwatch
8.can only query on primary key, sort key or indexes

use case: Serverless archiecture development , distributed serverless cache
doesnt have SQL query language aviable


DynamoDB for solution architect:
1.Operation: no operation needed, auto scaling capability,serverless
2.Security: full security through IAM policies, KMS encryption , SSl in flight
3.reliabilty: multi AZ, Backups
4.Performance: single digit miliseconds performance , performance doesnt degrade if your application scales
5.Cost: Pay per provisioned capacity and storage usage 


Athena Overview:

1.Fully serverless database with SQL capabilites
2.Used to query data in S3
3.pay per query
4.output result back to s3
5.Secured through IAM

use case: one time SQL queries, Serverless queries on s3, log analytics

Athena for Solution architect:

1.Operation: no operation needed , serverless
2.Security: IAM + s3 security
3.Reliabilty: managed service, highly avaiable
4.performance: queries scale based on data size
5.Cost: pay per query / Per TB of data scanned , serverless

Aws GLUE
1.Managed extract,transform and load(ETL) service
2.Useful to prepare and transform data for analytics
3.fully serverless service
