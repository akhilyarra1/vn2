Which Purchasing option is right for me.?

Resort  :   1.on-demand:coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
            2.Reserved:like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time , we may get a good discoved
            3.Spot:the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bider keeps the romms, you can get kicked up
            4.Dedicated hosts: we book an entire building of the resort
