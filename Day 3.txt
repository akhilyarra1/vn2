Amazon EC2

1.EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS offering
2.EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a service
3.It mainly consists in the capability of:
   1.Renting virtual machine(ec2)
   2.Storing data on virtual devices(EBS)
   3.Distributing load across machines(ELB)
   4.Scaling the services using an auto scaling group(ASG)

Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the cloud works
 
EC2 Configuration options

1.Operating System (OS) : LInux, Windows or Macos
2.How much compute power & cores (in cpu)
3.How much RAM
4.How much Storage space:
   1.Network-attached(EBS)
   2.hardware(ec2)
5.Public Ip address
6.Firewall : Security group
7.EC2 user data

ec2 user data

1.It is possible to bootstrap our instance using EC2 user data script
2.Bootstrap means launching commands when a machine starts
3.That script is only once run at the instance first start
4.EC2 user data is used to automate boot task such as:
   1.Installing updates
   2.Installing softwares
   3.Downloading common files from the internet
   4.Anything you can think of
5.Ec2 user data script runs with the root user

t2.micro is part of the aws free tier (up to 750 hours per month)


EC2 Instance Types:

m5.2xlarge

m:instance class
5:generation (AWS imporves them over time)
2xlarge:size within the instance



High cpu-High Ram:

1.Batch Processing workloads
2.Media Transcoding
3.High performance web server
4.HPC
5.machine learning
6.Gaming

Memory Optimized
Use case:
1.High performance , database
2.Distributed web scale cache stores
3.BI


Security Groups:
1.Security groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
2.They control how traffic is allowed into or out of ec2 instance
 
   inbound traffic   
www ------------- ec2 instance
    outbound traffic

3.Security groups only contain allow rules
4.reference by IP 

Port number:

22=SSH(secure shell) - log into a linux instance
21=FTP(File Transfer protocol) - upload files into a file share
22=SFTP(Secure FTP)- upload files using ssh
80=HTTP- unsecured websites
443=HTTPS - secured websites
3389 - RDP(Remote Dekstop protocol) - log into a windows instance



Hands -on
1.Well be launching our first virtual server using the aws console
2.well get a help-level approach to the various parameter
3.how we can connect with web with the help our IP address and user data
4.how to start/stop or terminate our ec2 instance
