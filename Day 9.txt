Network Load Balancer (NLB)

1.Network load balancer ( layer 4) :
  1.Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instance
  2.handle millions of request per seconds
  
NLB has one static IP per AZ and supports elastic IP


SSL /TLS 

1.An ssl certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer
2.SSL refers to SECURE SOCKETS LAYER , used to encrypt connections
3.TLS refers to Transport Layer security , which is a newer version
4.Nowadays,TLS certificates are mainly used , but people still refer ssl

5.Publi ssl certificates are issued by CA (certificate authorities)
6.Ssl certificate have any expiration date


Load Balancer - SSL

1. the load balancer uses an X.509 certificate 
2.you can manage using ACm ( aws certificate manager)



Auto scaling group (ASG)

1.In real-life the load on your websites and appplication can change
in the cloud , you can create and get rid of servers very quickly

the goal of ASG is to:
  1.Scale out( add EC2 instance) to match an increased load
  2.Scale in( remove ec2 instance ) to match a decreased load
  3.Automatically register new instance to a load balancer
